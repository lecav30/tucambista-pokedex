# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Steps to run the project

## 1. Clone this repository

Execute the following command in your prefer directory:

## 2. Install the dependencies

Execute the following command:

## 3. Run the program

Finally go to the url:

- Main page:

# How to use?

On the main page you will see 20 cards with the name of some pokemons, to see more
information about a specific pokemon you only need to pick the "More" button. If you do it,
you will see a card with some data of the pokemon and to go back to the main page just
pick the "Back" button
